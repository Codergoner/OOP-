# Community Engagement Platform Prototype

This project is a minimal Scala/JavaFX prototype showcasing a community engagement platform for sustainable agriculture. It demonstrates an object-oriented design with basic user roles, event management, resource sharing, and forum interactions.

## Project Structure
- `src/main/scala/community` – Scala sources for domain models and controllers
- `src/main/resources` – FXML views for JavaFX scenes
- `build.sbt` – Build definition

## Running
An [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) build definition is provided, but Scala/JavaFX are not installed in this environment. To run locally:

```bash
sbt run
```

This will launch the JavaFX application starting at the login screen.
